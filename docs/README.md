## Yet another deployment tool?
Attaché was designed around a deployment method I've been following for years now. As someone who uses Laravel a great deal, Laravel Envoy made a lot of sense and I developed a zero downtime approach to deployments that I've used many times with many different projects.

Attacheé is highly opinionated. You can read the article that Attaché was based on here:

[Zero Downtime Laravel Deployments with Envoy](https://medium.com/@warrickbayman/zero-downtime-laravel-deployments-with-envoy-version-2-227c8259e31c)

Attaché does most of the actual deployment work for you. A simple JSON configuration file makes it easy to get up and running quickly. No need for long complicated deployment scripts.

I think Attaché has a fairly wide set of use cases. But it can't do everything. If you need more control over your deployments, or have something specific, then Attaché isn't for you. Take a look at Laravel Envoy if Attaché doesn't quite fit your needs.
