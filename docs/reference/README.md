# Base Configuration
![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/tpg/attache?style=flat-square)

The Attach√© configuration requires at least two settings be present in the config file: the `repository` setting and an array `servers`. There must also be at least one server block inside the `servers` array, which in turn must have one of each `name`, `host`, `port`, `root`, `user` and `branch` attributes. A valid base configuration can look as follows:

```json
{
    "repository": "git@repository.git",
    "servers": [
        {
            "name": "production",
            "host": "myhost.test",
            "port": 22,
            "user": "user",
            "root": "/path/to/application",
            "branch": "master"
        }
    ]
}
```

To create a default base configuration you can run the `attache init` command inside a Git repository. This will automatically discover the Git remote URL and create a new base configuration (with a few extras).

You can add as many servers as you need as long as they each have a unique `name`. See the [servers](/reference/servers.md) referrence for more details.
